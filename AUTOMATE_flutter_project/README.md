# AUTOMATE_flutter_project

I use this to automate the process of creation of a minimal flutter project also removing the already present non-useful comments. After some changes to the shell script I can finally run this script from anywhere in my system.

I add this line :

```
export PATH="/media/shubham/6C0801E20801ABE0/IdeaProjects/personal-settings-config/AUTOMATE_flutter_project:$PATH"
```

which is the path to this project folder in my home/.bashrc file.

## How to use

To run this shell script type : ```flutter_automate name_of_the_project ```
