# personal-settings-config
This is a project to save my personal settings saved. e.g.:- My terminal configurations, software path configurations, etc..

I have also added a folder named AUTOMATE_flutter_project, I use this to automate the process of creation of a minimal flutter project also removing the already present non-useful comments.
